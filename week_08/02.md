## Paper Summary
The goal of this paper was to introduce a new method of securely deploying an internet-of-things (IoT) wireless sensor network by employing the use of a faraday cage that can set up the sensor nodes securely. The main motivation behind this product is that the main security threat of IoT sensor networks is the initial set up process where the nodes must connect to the central backend server. Since these types of networks are distributed networks, in some IoT protocols security information gets passed on through many nodes and an adversary may exploits that to gain access to the network. The authors created *Box* which is a Faraday Cage that prevents anyone from obtaining vital network connection through the initial network set up.

## Review
### Strengths
- Thorough explanations of the details behind the design and the motivation of the paper.
- Strong experimentation process and case study on how different users interact and trust the product


### Weaknesses
- Security discussion is very lacking and provides no useful feedback and analysis of other types of security holes in the set up process.

### Detailed Comments
The researchers did an excellent job explaining the design and motivations by providing scenarios and business logic to why the *Box* has an economic place in the IoT industry via how wireless sensor network managers have very difficult time maintaining and expanding their networks because of the strict requirements of most IoT protocols and the fact that these types of networks may be deployed over such a vast distance that updating and deploying securely, especially when workers with no security fluency are deploying new nodes to the network.

Their User Study was also very helpful as it demonstrated that even though the *Box* had such an important role in securing a wireless sensor network, workers who do not have a security background and those who do approach the *Box* with different view points, but ultimately both have the same conclusion about the product.

However, their security discussion is sorely lacking. While the background for the paper is solid, their discussion into the various other security questions do not have sustenance.

The main idea of the *Box* was to create a simple way for wireless node sensor network owners to deploy devices quickly to the field at scale. The problem is that the current architecture puts on so much weight on the owners and maintainers of the networks to deploy and update securely and this is where most of the main security concerns lay. Updating firmware requires some level of technical knowledge and can be dangerous to the security of the network if someone unqualified or not wanted were to do something wrong or malicious during this step. Along with the previously stated protocol problems of IoT protocols, wireless senor network owners take on so much burden in maintenance.

*Box* is a cost effective solution that helps alleviate the problem and scales extremely well. Simply, place all the wireless sensor devices into the faraday cage and through over-the-air (OTA) transmission will either set up the devices with the requisite network information for initial deployment or updating to the correct firmware. To achieve this, the only requirement is to have an OTA capable bootloader so that the *Box* can update the firmware securely. This is feasible and cheap to the network owners as this places the expense on the manufacturer.

It is composed of two parts: the faraday cage itself, and a Raspberry Pi 3. The faraday cage is made up of materials that can block many high power injection attacks and does not leak any EM radiation for a side-channel attack. The Raspberry Pi is connected to multiple things including a speaker, LEDs, and a magnet sensor. The magnet sensor prevents the Raspberry Pi from doing anything when the *Box* is not secured closed. The speakers and LEDs are the main interface in which directions and information will be presented to the user.

The Raspberry Pi itself would be preprogrammed to contain the network information and any new firmware that needs to be installed onto the sensors. When the box is secured, the Raspberry Pi will create its own ad hoc network. From here, the Pi will then check to see if it needs to install any new firmware onto the devices. Any new firmware will need to also have been loaded onto the Pi before the *Box* was closed. If there is new firmware to install, it will then use the OTA capable bootloader of the device to securely flash the firmware onto it. Afterwards it then transmits the network information for initial connection to the central backend before shutting down the sensors. From here, the sensors are ready to be set up in the field without any additional work from the operator.

### Experimentation

The authors tested the usability of their hardware solution. The researchers hypothesized that the *Box* solution was 1) faster than needing to fiddle around with wires and 2) intuitive as to not allow users to make security-critical errors. They gathered 31 subjects, 21 male and 10 female, in the age range of 23 - 53. Out of the 31 total people, 20 had computer science and electrical engineering backgrounds that they considered *experts*. Those who do not have experience with security or those who possessed a degree that is not of computer science or electrical engineering were deemed *novices*. All of the participants were given the task of setting up a wireless sensor network using the box by programming sensor nodes.

The authors do note that due to the very small sample size, their findings are purely qualitative. All in all, both groups were able to program the nodes using the box faster than using a wired method while making fewer errors and being less hesitant in using the technology as shown in the figure below.

When surveyed at the end of the end of the experiment, everyone expressed positively about the *Box*, especially those who had industrial training. There were some individuals in the experts group were a bit more hesitant about the product as they were more curious to know the inner workings and tiny details about how the device worked, along with more detailed explanations in the instructions that they were given. In the end, the authors conclude that their product can help change an ever growing industry.

### Questions From the Audience
How efficient and user friendly is this method? Would it be something to implement in replace of existing industry methods?
According to the results of the paper, the cage is a user friendly method, and that they can still implement improvements to make using the cage even more user friendly. It can be considered for replacing existing industry methods, as it allows for inexperienced users to setup sensors in bulk.

The box acts a EM shield to attenuate attacks, how effective is it against high powered signals?
The intention of the Box is to prevent leakage when the Box is communicating with the sensors, so as to prevent eavesdropping. If we are talking about attackers interfering with the setup process with a high power signal, the box uses secret keys to set up each device so it may be known when a device is setup incorrectly.

Is it possible to use the box if higher levels of shielding are desired?
The box can be fabricated with extra levels of shielding if the extra security is needed. The box constructed in the paper was created as a concept, so better designs/materials may be created in order to improve shielding.

It seems like the time savings are negligible for the possible security concerns introduced? (About 2 minutes total for wired upgrades vs  30 seconds for the box)
Along with the time savings, are various other benefits when using the Box, which include users with no experience being able to use the Box, bulk deployment of wireless sensors, and being able to assign customized firmware to different sensors.

Will the box be insecure if some sensors are manipulated by an attacker?
The paper makes the assumption that "no desired hardware or software is inserted into a sensor node", but the box would be insecure if the sensors were tampered with. Attackers may be able to extract information from the communication between the box and sensors if they were able to modify the sensors.

The box seems not convenient, is it possible to use NFC?
It is difficult to implement a method which utilizes NFC, as additional modifications would have to be added to hardware which can increase size and cost, whereas the Box utilizes over-the-air firmware distribution which is starting to be adopted by chips.

What are some examples of devices that can utilize the FC?
Some devices that can utilize the faraday cage are, Wi-Fi routers, Wi-Fi repeaters & relays, or really any device that involves in wireless communication and supports over-the-air firmware distribution.

The cage seems like a headache... would a method similar to push-button based WPS be more practical yet still provide a certain standard of OTA security?
A push-button based WPS may be the simplest method for pairing devices, but the cage allows for the bulk deployment of multiple sensors which may be favorable in a large industrial setting.
