## Paper Summary
Due to the low cost of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, new IoT applications are emerging. Many IoT devices perform critical functions, such as smart building control or smart medical devices. Any attack to these devices can have devastating consequences. Zigbee and Wi-Fi are two common protocol specifications used with IoT devices. Both of these protocols use a fixed preamble for all frame types. This paper explores the effect a Truncate-after-Preamble (TaP) attack has on Zigbee and Wi-Fi devices. A TaP attack leverages truncated packets to trick receivers into listening to nonexistent transmissions at the expense of valid transmissions, causing starvation. The authors implement a TaP attack on an SDR platform and evaluate the effectiveness of the attack on five Zigbee devices and seven Wi-Fi devices sold by different manufacturers. The authors found that all Zigbee devices are vulnerable to the attack and the Wi-Fi devices are vulnerable to varying degrees, showing that over 90% packet loss can be caused on a Zigbee or Wi-Fi channel. The authors propose several methods that can be helpful for detecting and mitigating TaP attacks. After reading the paper, it seems the motivation behind this paper was to find an attack type that is more energy efficient than other attacks.

## Review
### Strengths
- Strong explanation of Zigbee and Wi-Fi protocols, and the additional attacks that said protocols are vulnerable to
- In-depth explanation of the TaP attack and adversarial model used to carry out the attack
- Detailed graphs/graphics to support their findings
- Detection methods from simple to complex offers varying levels of detection

### Weaknesses
- Not clear on the dB differences, what distance (ex. meters from target) are they testing at?

### Detailed Comments / Audience Questions
The authors provide ample background on the IEEE 802.15.4 (Zigbee) and 802.11 (Wi-Fi) protocols. In each section pertaining to the given protocol, the authors discuss different attacks that can be leveraged against each protocol. The authors compare and contrast the existing attacks with their TaP attack, and this comparison is useful to help differentiate their TaP attack and methods used.

Furthermore, the authors provide an in-depth explanation of the TaP attack and adversarial model used to carry out the attack. Through their graphs/graphics based off of data from their findings, the authors adequately support their claims of over 90% packet loss that can be caused by a TaP attack. However, the authors do not list at what distance they are testing the targets at, so the differences in power (dB) are not as useful without that information. But, the authors do offer detection methods for a TaP attack, addressing varying levels of detection from simple to complex for any given application.

Audience Questions:
- Practicality? Would this attack be a common threat that should be soon mitigated?

This attack has the possibility to be a threat, however the authors never disclosed the distances at which they were testing the TaP attack. So, the TaP attack could end up being negligibly more dangerous than existing attacks when considering the amount of power and setup time the adversary must consider.

- Since they concluded firmware is the reason for the different results among Wi-Fi cards, would a update to patch this be possible?

I believe that a firmware update from the manufacturer would have the possibility to solve some problems. Specifically, as Dr. Yao mentioned, the firmware can specify the back-off time for a packet, which can then change the characteristic of your Wi-Fi functionality to any given application (ex. low data rate ESP32).

- Why are the attacks  five to six orders of magnitudes more energy-efficient than constant jamming attacks?

They are more energy efficient because the attacker does not have to constantly transmit like a constant jammer. For example, the attacker can announce 127 bytes of data but only send 10 bytes, as the device is still anticipating 127 bytes to arrive. Coupled with using the authors' Energy Amplification Ration (EAR) metric, an attack with an EAR up to 50 db is still effective, or 60 db for some devices. So, the authors conclude less power can be used to still achieve results.

- Is it possible to prevent the attack by implementing a better protocol? e.g. adding authentication in the preamble?

Yes, adding authentication to the preamble can allow this to be preventable. The authors propose multiple detection methods to assist in mitigating a TaP attack: NIC-level detection (network interface controller), time-domain detection, and preamble-counter detection (requiring access to data-link/PHY layer). Any additional authentication can assist the Zigbee and Wi-Fi protocols.

- Is there a viable prevention against this attack without having to create a new chip/new protocol?

Yes, additional detection methods are discussed in the previous question.

- What is the reason the Wi-Fi devices widely differ in terms of their vulnerability to TaP attacks in their experiment?

As previously discussed, different Wi-Fi devices run different firmware, and in firmware the back-off time for a packet can be specified, which can then change the characteristic of your Wi-Fi functionality to any given application (ex. low data rate ESP32). The back-off is specified in the 802.11 protocol however the parameter value is not specified in 802.11, so it is up to manufacturers to set a back-off time value.

- Could you check if there is a delay between the preamble vs data packet to check if there is an attack?

Yes, time-domain detection can assist in detecting a TaP attack. If analysis can be performed by measuring RF signal, one can see that a TaP attack packet signal is truncated compared to a full data packet as the authors discussed.

- Would an attacker be able identify a specific device, in close proximity to other Zigbee devices, to direct the TaP attack?

Yes, if there are other Zigbee devices in a similar quadrant as the targeted Zigbee device, and additional reconnaissance is performed by the attacker, the attacker can direct their attacks to that device.

### Implementation / Experimentation
The Zigbee experimental setup resembles [Xin et al.](https://doi.org/10.1145/3345768.3355907), but the physical layer testbed is based on [gr-ieee-802-15-4 transceiver](https://www.ccs-labs.org/bib/bloessl2013gnu/bloessl2013gnu.pdf) for generating and receiving Zigbee packets, as well as custom blocks to perform the PHY packet truncation.

They are using stand-along target devices as listed in Table 1.
{{< figure src="https://github.com/gustybear-teaching/course_ee693e_2020_fall/raw/main/week_05/images/02Table1.png" title="[Table 1]" width="300" >}}

As shown in Figure 2 they are broadcasting IEEE 802.15.4 "beacon requests" from the SDR (software defined radio).
{{< figure src="https://github.com/gustybear-teaching/course_ee693e_2020_fall/raw/main/week_05/images/02Fig2.png" title="[Figure 2]" width="300" >}}

They measure the presence of the beacons under different adversarial conditions. This setup is more realistic for typical IoT home devices that operate as stand-alone devices and are not meant to be programmatically controlled by a host device during normal operation.

The results of starvation dependence on announced packet length for Zigbee devices are shown in Fig 3.
{{< figure src="https://github.com/gustybear-teaching/course_ee693e_2020_fall/raw/main/week_05/images/02Fig3.png" title="[Figure 3]" width="300" >}}

All 5 tested devices are vulnerable to the TaP attack. As you can see in the graph, packets are only transmitted during the pink shaded area on the left, and close to 100% packet loss occurs for the whole range of delay offsets spanning the announced length. Figure 4 contains results for Preamble Receiver Starvation (PRS) tested on the 5 devices.
{{< figure src="https://github.com/gustybear-teaching/course_ee693e_2020_fall/raw/main/week_05/images/02Fig4.png" title="[Figure 4]" width="300" >}}

The graph in Figure 4 shows a mostly linear PRS slope which means it is consistent with Fig 3. Thus, the longer the announced packet length, the higher the percentage of undelivered packets. For example, this means that an attacker can announce 127 bytes of data, only send 10 bytes and this attack will be 90% or more as effective as a brute-force jamming attack

Additional tests were performed for starvation dependence on attacker's signal strength to assess the minimal power needed to perform an effective attack using the Energy Amplification Ration (EAR) metric. Figure 5 shows for all Zigbee devices, an attack with EAR up to 50 db is still effective, or 60 db for some devices. This means that the adversary's signal strength can be 300 times weaker than the victim's and still impact it. This also means that an attacker can spend about 6 orders of magnitude less transmit energy when compared to a constant jammer.
{{< figure src="https://github.com/gustybear-teaching/course_ee693e_2020_fall/raw/main/week_05/images/02Fig5.png" title="[Figure 5]" width="300" >}}

Wi-Fi experimental setup relies of physical layer testbed resembling [Xin et al.](https://doi.org/10.1145/3345768.3355907), but signal transmitted over-the-air rather than via RF cables. Table 2 list of tested Wi-Fi devices. Control machine of transmitter and receiver using [gr-ieee-802-11 library for GNU Radio](https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2017.2751474), source code used to generate truncated packets at [NISLAB @ Boston University GitHub](https://github.com/nislab).

Two Wi-Fi experiments were performed based on packet length and signal strength: starvation dependence on announced packet length, and starvation dependence on attackers signal strength.

Figure 6 shows performance of the tested WiFi devices with respect to the PRS metric. The authors observed that vulnerability to TaP attacks differs widely; some are widely susceptible as PRS keeps increasing linearly whereas for others the curve remains fairly flat. The reason is that the receiver state machine of these devices do not wait until the end of the announced packet length in order to start receiving new packets.
{{< figure src="https://github.com/gustybear-teaching/course_ee693e_2020_fall/raw/main/week_05/images/02Fig6.png" title="[Figure 6]" width="300" >}}

Fig 7 shows for all WiFi devices the attack succeeds with an EAR of up to 30 dB, some devices are higher. This means that a TaP attack succeeds when the adversary's signal strength is about 30 times weaker than the victim's signal strength. The authors also conclude that an attacker can spend about 5 orders of magnitude less transmit energy when compared to a constant jammer. This is where
