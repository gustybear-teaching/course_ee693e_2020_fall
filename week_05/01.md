## Paper Summary
With the rise of the Internet of Things (IoT) where many devices are connected to each other to provide a particular service comes with many costs that manufacturers must deal with in order to keep the cost of such devices low and that does not impede on the devices function. A particular IoT protocol that the researchers are targeting is Zigbee. Controlled by the Zigbee Alliance, it is a low level connectivity protocol that allows low power communication on a network. Many modern IoT devices use this protocol and it is the one of the popular ones implemented in certain devices such as smart locks. They believe that this is a serious threat as smart devices that consumers use to protect themselves physically (such as using a smart door lock), the vulnerabilities goes from an internet security breach to a physical security breach as these devices often interact with the physical world frequently. They design Zigator, a Phython based security analyzer that determines if the network is safe and secure, along with a hardware testbed platform to use in tandem with Zigator.

## Review
### Strengths
- Strong background information about the protocol and the vulnerabilities that are in it due to the design choices that have been made to maintain such a low power cost.
- Clear explanations about the strategy that adversaries will use to exploit vulnerable networks.

### Weaknesses
- Not a lot of detail in how the program functions and we are only given a high level explanation.
- A lack of discussion on attack models and the potency of these kinds of attacks on the network.
- No power and compute cost analysis of attacks mentioned.

### Detalied Comments
The authors go in depth on the reasonings to why the security vulnerability exists in the first place. Their main finding is that most networks are being configured in a more centralized fashion. Where there exists a main device that acts like a switch where it will route packets sent from one end node to another, and it verifies all the new nodes that are being connected to the network. The vulnerability lies in the new node connection as the process exposes important information to gain access to the network, and since all packets in a centralized Zigbee network is routed to the central device, adversaries can potentially exploits these two facts to gain access to the network.

However, the paper does not go in depth on the software, Zigator, and how it is built. We are told that it a Python based program with a user interface that has the capabilities of running the analysis on the networks, but nothing further than the repository. The authors also do not expand on how more sophisticated the attacks can become or how it can affect the industry when the effectivness of selective jammer that they propose looks like it can be veryt potent on the industrial scale. They also do not consider any power or compute requirements to the attacks. Surely the compute cost is relativley small considering Zigbee packets are not too big, however the lack of a power cost analysis is unusual since a great point in the IoT world is the low power to compute ratio it has. It looks like they assume the attacker has a laptop that is on a full charge. This ties into the other weakness of lack of potency and other avenues of attack since a good question would be if we can create a low power device that can do all the things that Zigbee can do.


### Implementation
The authors gave the code repositories for the [wireshark profile](https://github.com/akestoridis/wireshark-zigbee-profile), [GNU radio flow graph for Zigator](https://github.com/akestoridis/grc-ieee802154), and the [USB receiver firmware](https://github.com/akestoridis/atusb-attacks), and the [source code for Zigator](https://github.com/akestoridis/zigator).

The authors set a few objectives to measure the security effectiveness of a device: 1) Authenticity, where the network should not allow unauthorized devices from impersonating other devices, 2) Integrity, where the network must be able to detect and reject tampered packets, 3) Confidentiality, unauthorized devices should not have access to unauthorized information about the network, and 4) Availability, the networking services should be free for devices on the network when it is needed.

The researchers set up the receiver and IEEE 802.15.4 antennae to be able to sniff packets, inject packets, and jam packets. The researchers used Wireshark to organize and colour code the various packets that the radio is receiving via a PCAP configuration file. To jam and inject packets, the researchers used the Scapy library for its ability to parse and modify packets so that the antennae can inject and jam packets.

For packet jamming, the researchers developed selective jammer that jams the reception of a real packet by forcing a state transition to where the receiver no longer actively listens to packets. Specifically, when a RX_START interrupt is detected, we retrieve the packet length and the next byte from the frame buffer until the jamming condition is met. Then we force the receiver to transition from the BUSY_RX state to the PLL_ON state via an injected FORCE_PLL_ON. By doing this, the transmission of the real packet is lost as the receiver is not listening for anything. After a set amount of time, the receiver then goes back to the RX_ON state to start receiving new packets.

[Zigator](https://github.com/akestoridis/zigator), a Python based network analyzer that focuses on Zigbee networks. The authors made heavy use of the Scapy library as it allowed them to modify and create packets. Although the library that the Zigator is using does not have any functionality that modify certain parts of Zigbee packet headers, so they developed that also their functions are avalaible through the Zigator source code. Within Zigator, there are a few pre-programmed attacks (selective jamming and key-transport attacks e.g.) that the user could utilize it out of the box on a network. It also has some data visualization in the terms of Wireshark profiles which can be found [here](https://github.com/akestoridis/wireshark-zigbee-profile).

### Experimentation
The researchers tested 10 different Zigbee devices that used the SmartThings Hub as the network coordinator. The devices were connected to the network one at a time, all while Zigator was running. Some of the devices were legacy Zigbee devices, and others were Zigbee3.0 compliant.

They were focused on two different types of attacks, a reconnaissance attack and a key-transport attack. The goal of the reconnaissance was to be able to 1) identify topology, 2) legacy devices, and 3) NWK commands. The claim that they can successfully trace out the topology by sniffing the MAC headers and create distinct source-destination pairs which would yield an inferred topology since in a centralized network, the roles of the nodes are more strictly defined. The identification of legacy devices is simply by looking for a specific NWK commands, specifically the "End Device Timeout Requests" and the "End Device Timeout Response" this is due to the fact that legacy Zigbee devices will never transmit those commands as they were added to the protocol in Zigbee3.0 therefore if they can find evidence, or lack thereof, of these commands, then they can infer the type of device. According to the researchers, they are able to 100% identify these commands. Lastly, the identification of the NWK commands. The authors provided their decision tree to determine the type of command as illustrated in the figure below.

{{< figure src="https://github.com/gustybear-teaching/course_ee693e_2020_fall/raw/main/week_05/images/desiciontree.png" title="Desicion Tree of Determining NWK Command" width="300" >}}

They claim that out of the 12 commands, they were able to identify 6 out of 12 correctly with 100% accuracy.

The goal of the key-transport attack is that in Zigbee3.0 networks, the security key that is needed to correctly join the server is now random and virtually impossible to guess (usually takes form of a QR code that needs to be verified with setting up). In Zigbee3.0 networks, the keys are distributed through the central node. This is the biggest weakness of the centralized Zigbee network as a successful sniffing, and selective jamming could leak the key, where it could be used to connect unauthorized devices to the network.

The researchers were successful in all experiments conducted with the aide of Zigator.

### Questions From the Audience
- Can you expand more on "The attacker may utilize more sohpisted hardware" In what other ways do you think the attackers can do to sniff packets.
The main attack that these networks is vulnerable is the fact that jamming is very easy so mainly "more sophisticated hardware" can be translated into more powerful hardware in tandem with a more complex attack. While the jamming is a very big vulnerability, the fact that key-transport attacks are also successfull can mean the possibility of a man-in-the-middle attacks being possible if the adversary can connect a false node to the network.

- Would these attack scenarios still work if all devices were using Zigbee3.0, and not a mix of legacy
Yes these attack scenarios would still work as discussed in the paper, a secure NWK layer is not sufficient enough to prevent the attacks modeled.

- How would the MAC layer security prevent the attacks.
MAC layer security would allow the central node to help verify packets so all attacks that use packet injection might be less effective. It also allows greater control of network access as false nodes will need to verify with the central node before being able to become authorized, so a secure MAC layer would help prevent any key-transport attacks.

- Could Zigbee be improved against these attacks with minimal cost to power consumption/processing usage?
- what can Zigbee alliance do to enhance the security of Zigbee?
Zigbee could potentially be improved to be greater resiliant to these kinds of attacks, however a big constraint with the devices is that they need to be very power efficient with the minimal batter that they possess and also need to be cheap enough to manufacture and produce. So an improved encryption would mean adding more complex hardware that can drain enough power for the devices to no longer conform to the idea of the IoT, rendering them unprofitable and therefore useless.

- Could the network key also be transported physically too? (Like USB)
This would be physically impossible for some IoT devices (such as some sensor nodes) since the idea of the IoT is that devices need to seamless connect and comminucate to other devices on the internet, so manufacturers would not even build in a USB port into an IoT sensor becuase it was useless to do so. So while the physical key transportation would help improve the securtity, it would be physically impossible for some devices to comply.

- Can they standardize the size of NWK commands to prevent extrapolation of information? Especially the Network Update command.
They could, but 1) smaller commands will need to be padded, adding useless bits onto the already slow network and potentially lead to a slowdown in transmit performance, and 2) that does not stop the attacker there are other methods of detecting the precise commands given strategies such as EM leakage analysis, or simply even packet sniffing and creating a Machine Learning model to help ditinguish between each of the commands.
