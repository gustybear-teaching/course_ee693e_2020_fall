## Paper Summary
For large scale deployed multi-antenna wireless networks in homes and office buildings, it is possible that an attacker can track the movement of people inside, by measuring the signal strength using receivers placed outside the premises. In order to prevent such an attack, this paper introduces a framework where a defender (e.g. administrator of the networks) can randomly choose some transmitters to turn off so that the attacker will not able to distinguish a obstacle caused by movement and a random shut down. The paper models the behaviours of the defender and attacekr as a Stackelberg game, where the defender chooses some strategy to begin the game so that the minimal payoff is maximized for any strategy that selected by the attacker (with the knowledge of the defender's strategy). The authors analyzed their framework with several payoff functions. They showed that, for such payoff functions, finding the optimal defending strategy can be reduced to some linear programmings, therefore is polynomial time sovable. The authors also demonstrated that their framework can be adapted to some other problems as well, by using the same linear programming strategy. Finally, the authors carried out experiments with some artifitial network planning that verifies their theoretical results.

## Review
### Strengths
The main strengths are
- The authors introduced a general framework to analyze the defending/attacking strategies of the Radio Window Atacks.
- Their framework can be adapted to different scenerios by choosing different payoff functions.
- The authors showed that one can find the optimal strategies in their framework efficiently, by solving some linear programming.

### Weaknesses
The main weaknesses are
- It is not clear how the payoff functions that selected in the paper reflects real security gain.
- Their linear programming actually has exponentially many variables when multiple location can be selected by the attacker.
- The authors only tested their approach with an artificially consructed network planning. 

### Detalied Comments
The main idea of the radio window attack is illustrated in the following picture:

To prevent the attacker from obtaining the movment information, the defender can choose to turn of the transmitters randomly according the the possible attacking zones of the attacker. The authors defined the payoff of the attacekr to be (roughly) the expected online transmitter that is reachable by the attacker. Which can be expressed as a linear function in terms of the probabilities that each transmitter will turn off with coefficeints determined by the system parameters (e.g. the reachibility of the attacker to different transmitters). The linear programming is also constrained by the attacker's cost. However, when multiple locations can be allowed to the attacker, there will be exponentially many such constrains. Thus, it makes the linear programming difficult to solve.

### Implementation
To implement their framework, the authors considered the situation where there are multiple attackers with different kinds of resources. For example, the types of receivers they use can affect the antenna gains and therefore utilities can vary. The defender is assumed to have a prior distribution that gives the probability of each attacker type. Formally, the optimal strategy can be reduced to the following linear programming:

### Experimentation
The authors considered the following network planning:

With the following reachable matrix:

### Questions from Audience
(1) How would a directional antenna differ from an omni-directional antenna to detect movements? Any change in strategy and accuracy?

For omni-directional transmitter the attacker can measure the RSS from all transmitters, while for directional transmitters the attacker can only measre the RSS from certain region. In that sense, a directional transmitter would be more secure and harder to detect the movement.

(2) How much movement do you have to hide before you can say privay has been kept

This paper does not provide a measure to quantify the actual privacy (which can only be qualitative read from the utility function). This can be a direction for future research.

(3) If a transmitter is turned of how can the attacker detect movement using the signals from that transmitter?

If the transmitter is turned off, the attacker will not be able to detect the movement.

(4) Would an attacker be able to utilize machine learning to bypass this defense (assuming they somehow got training data)?

It is possible that machine learning can be help to improve the detection accuracy. However, this is really a ultility-security trade-off, since the defender can also adjust the strategy of switching off transmitters to counter the effect.

(5) the attackers can place mutiple receivers around, is it possible for them to classify a drop in RSS is due to an obstacle or a transmitter is turned off?

Yes, for omni-directional transmitters, an obstacle can often block one direction of the signal while the other receivers can still receve the signal. For directional transmitter, it will be hard to distinguish.

(6) How does location accuracy scale with number of trasmitters/receivers?

As shown in their result, the payoff will increase as more recivers used by the attacker. However, there is a threshold, above which more recievers will not help incrasing the accuracy any more.

(7) Is the security location vulnerability come from the manufacturer side or an inherint flaw with how devices connect to a wireless network?

It is coming from the physical nature of electromagnetic wave.

(8) What types of situations do you see this method implemented? In typical wireless networks in buildings? Or only in specific cases/areas that require more secure connections?

The method could be implemented in government or milittary buildings where security and privacy are of high priority. For other situiation, the privacy gain is actually very limited compare to the ultility loss.
