## Paper Summary
This paper study the problem of protecting location privacy of mobile users when the service provider is not trusted. The authors proposed a security protocol named Zipphone. Basically, the protocol tries to assign random pseudonyms to the users that are shared within a community, so that the provider is hard to link the pseudonyms with each individual user. To achieve this, the paper introduces a mechanism of refreshing the pseudonyms that minimizes the trajectory linking while keep the utility in an acceptable level. To analyze their protocol, the authors introduces two notions of user behaviors: predictability and mixing. Based on this, the authors performed evaluates on public datasets with users grouped according to their predictability and mixing.

## Review
### Strengths
The strengths are as follows
- The protocol does not rely on the cooperation of the service provider. While previous works often have such a requirement.
- The authors evaluated a deanonymization attack that uses a combination of location profiling and trajectory linking, and showed that it is effective in identifying long-term
pseudonyms.
- The authors use two separate datasets of call detail records to evaluate the protocol and demonstrated that a Zipphone user can defend against the deanonymization attacks by renewing her identifier regularly.
- The paper also evaluated the utility cost in terms of time offline and battery life, and showed it to be minimal

### Weaknesses
The weaknesses are as follows:
- In order to keep anonymity, the community need a large number of users to share the identities.
- The credential needs to be purchases anonymity, which is not practical.
- The protocol require phone that support software SIM.
- Users would never be able to quantify their privacy gains as there is no way to determine the number of other Zipphone users.
- The protocol cannot prevent physical attacks, e.g. radio frequency fingerprinting.
- The evaluation is limited, since the attackers can use additional information (e.g., time of day or favorite locations) and uses more advanced classifier.

### Detailed Comments
The main idea of the proposed protocol is to refresh pseudonyms of users as frequent as possible so that, so that the trace of each users cannot be distinguished. However, in order to preserve utility, one can't refresh as frequent as one want. In order to solve this problem, the authors introduced the following refreshing mechanism.

To evaluate the protocol, the author consider the following location profiling algorithm.

Where one assumes the trace of each user as a Markov chain, and the transition probability is known to the attacker (which can be obtained from the past traces of the user). In order to link a trace to a particular user, the attacker find the user that has the maximum likelihood probability on the trace. However, due to the refresh of the pseudonyms, the attacker cannot always observe a full trace of a single user, since she may uses different pseudonyms in different segments. To address this issue, the author introduces the following trace linking algorithm.

Where the attacker computes an universe transition matrix according to the behaviors of all users and then link two traces with so that the start of one trace has the maximum transition probability from the end of another trace.

Overall, the idea of using random pseudonyms to protect location privacy is interesting. However, as mentioned before, there are also many limitations. The major problem is that the privacy gain is hard to quantify. Moreover, the author only considered a particular attacking strategy, i.e., the trace linking. Which cannot rule out more effective attacking strategies.


### Implementation
The authors considered two data set, 1. PhoneLab, which is an Android testbed comprising 593 phones distributed to students at the University of Buffalo campus; 2. RealityMining, which is a dataset released by MIT that tracks a group of 100 mobile phone users across various contexts. The datasets were partitioned into four groups according the Mixing and Prediction scores of the users. specifically, the author determined thresholds for the Mixing and Prediction scores, such that for the users with mixing score above the threshold it is marked as M, otherwise nM. And similarly, predictable users are marked as P, otherwise marked as nP. The evaluation was done by comparing the attacking accuracy of each groups.

The data are split up into several sets of three months; training was done on the first two months, and testing was done on the third month. The privacy gained is quantified in terms of reduced attacker accuracy. And the utility is measured in terms of time spent offline during the testing period. The author also performed evaluations on the energy overhead that caused by the Zipphone protocol. Which is tested by the energy consumption of single association/disassociation on both 3G and 4G networks.


### Experimentation
The result shows that, indeed, the groups of higher Prediction score or lower Mixing scores are easy to detect.

The following result shows that longer traces are easier to identify.

And energy consumption on 3G and 4G.

### Question from Audience

(1) Even with sufficient amount of historical data, how would it still be possible to prevent traces?

Since the pseudonyms are changed frequently, one cannot get long enough traces to do inference.

(2) If there were more people using zipphone, would it be even harder for service providers to trace each user, as there are more unknown variables now

Yes, more users more secure.

(3) why are longer traces easier to identify and link with other traces?

Since the behavior of different user are different, with longer trace such difference will be easier to extract.

(4) Would any apps that require constant location tracking be affected by Zipphone e.g., Google Timeline, or is the downtime minimal?

No, such services could obtain location information through GPS (if it is authorized by the user).

(5) Zipphone triggers periodic disassociation/association from the mobile carrier. does this feature help attacker to perform trajectory linking?

No, this will make the provider harder to distinguish the users.

(6) Do you think there can be any improvements to the proposed architecture of the implementation of Zipphone?

Yes, one may propose different refreshing schemes that achieve better utility-privacy trade-off.

(7) Why develop a new protocol when one could create a new encryption method for GPS that does not have a big accuracy penalty?

This is a physical layer security problem, encryption on the data layer does not really help.

(8) Calls using 3G /4G are featured in the experiment, while the paper claims LTE remains a risk due to carrier call records. How do you think 5G fits into this?

This protocol will be less efficient on 5G, since one will be switching the cellular tower more often, which will result in more frequent refreshing. Therefore, the utility will be decreased.
