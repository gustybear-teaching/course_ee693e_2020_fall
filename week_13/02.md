## Paper Summary
In this paper, authors introduce KRATOS, a multi-user multi-device-aware access control system. KRATOS can resolve policy conflicts in smart home systems (SHSs). KRATOS consists of a flexible policy-based user control system, a formal policy language to describe users' desires, and a policy negotiation module to solve conflict automatically. They implemented KRATOS on a multi-user multi-device smart home system and evaluated its performance on the 219 different policies that collected from real-life SHSs. The results showed that KRATOS can resolve conflicting demands with minimal user interactions in their experimental scenarios. Moreover, they tested KRATOS against five different threats arising from inadequate access control systems, and KRATOS identified all those threats.

## Review
### Strengths
- They tried to resolve the policy conflicts in a multi-user multi-device smart home system. According to the results they provided, KRATOS can resolve all conflicts with 100% success rates.
- They collected real-life data from smart home users and designed KRATOS based on the issues they found in real-life.
- The time to resolve the same kind of conflicts increased linearly as the number of policies increased.
### Weaknesses
- In order to reduce the number of admin interactions to resolve hard conflicts manually, administrators need knowledge of how to set up priority for each user.
- They only tested KRATOS in a scenario of limited number of users.
- They didn’t consider the user experience when the number of policies increases or the priority configuration is not optimal.
- The structure of this paper can be improved if they placed the algorithms in the implementation section. The implementation will be clearer.
### Detalied Comments
Traditional access control mechanisms proposed for personal devices only target single-user scenarios, and they cannot work well in multi-user multi-device smart home systems. They also cause some security issues such as a new user gets full access to all devices and can delete devices from the network. Thus, authors designed and implemented KRATOS that can fulfill a complex, symmetric, and conflicting demands of the users. They invited 43 different smart home users to try KRATOS and collected the data. From those data, they recorded different conflicting scenarios experienced by the users and asked them to use KRATOS to assign policies. The other advantage is that their algorithm is efficient because when they increased the number of policies, conflicts, users, or devices, the running time increased linearly.
 
On the other hand, KRATOS requires administrators to have enough knowledge to enter policies. Hard conflicts require admin interactions, and the hard conflicts grow fast if more users with the same priority are added to the SHS. Similarly, users may receive many notifications for soft conflicts. Although their experiment provided good results with 100% success rates, the experiment was based on the data they collected. As they mentioned in this paper, usability should be tasted in a real-life situation.
### Implementation
They defined three kinds of policies: demand policy, restriction policy, and location-based policy, and they also defined three different conflicts: hard conflict, soft conflict, and restriction conflict. The implementation of KRATOS was based on those definitions.\
KRATOS consists of several modules:
- User interaction module collects priority assignment data and device policies from the users. It collects the user credentials and device policies generated using the access policy language.
- Back-end module receives and stores the data from the user interaction module and processes the data by generating a user priority list and a device policy list.
- Policy manager module collects the user priority list and device policy list and initiates the policy negotiation and generation processes.
- Policy Execution Module enforces the final policies generated from the policy negotiation process, so smart home devices can be controlled through an Android app.
They implemented KRATOS in Samsung SmartThings platform where they connected multiple devices and sensors to Samsung SmartThings Hub and collected data from users. Based on the data they collected, they categorized four scenarios: multiple policies for the same device, multiple policies for different devices, multiple apps for the same devices, and single app for multiple devices. They also implemented five threats on their SHS for further evaluation of KRATOS. For the implementation of the policy enforcement, they modified ten different SmartThings apps, so those apps connected to the back-end module and captured the policies generated by KRATOS. Conditional statements of those apps were appended, so a command executes only if KRATOS allows.
### Experimentation
- Table 2 is the summary of policy conflicts and negotiations in different scenarios.

- Table 3 shows the evaluation of the effectiveness in preventing different threats in SHS. KRATOS can detect all these threats with 100% accuracy and notify users with delays less than one second.

- Table 4 shows the impact of KRATOS in normal operations of the SHS. As the number of policies increases from 10 to 30, average negotiation time increases linearly.

### Questions
(1) Practicality? By introducing an increased number of inputs to the user interface, would this be helpful for new/inexperienced users?
 
Yes, it will help inexperienced users. In addition, they can reduce the number of notifications, so users won’t see too many rejections.
 
(2) Novelty? Related work is introduced where such conflicts are resolved. How is kratos 'novel' or how does it differ from existing architecture?
 
Existing solutions only provide binary decisions. For example, if a user gets access to a SHS, he or she gets full access to all devices. Kratos negotiated in the back-end and can reduce the user interactions.
 
(3) Open ended question - How effective would this method be? Considering various scenarios of complicatited social norms and relationships. Creating different levels of access control may be difficult to evaluate within such a complex home environment.
 
In a scenario that only has several users, and priorities are set in a good way, this method is effective. As the numbers of users and policies increase the performance of Kratos will decrease, and it may have deadlock if there are too many hard conflicts.
 
(4) With the current algorithms, how scalable is the proposal. What if an even larger IOT network with significantly more users tried using KRATOS, would it still be able to decide on policies effectively?
 
No, it is not scalable. This kind of concurrency system will be break down if we add more users. A priority queue is needed in this case.
 
(5) Is the usability of KRATOS tested in a real-life smart home environment?
 
Based on their implementation, it is usability in a SHS with not too many users. They need to improve KARTOS if they want to test it in a real-life SHS.
 
(6) What is the feasibility of extending KRATOS to commercial applications?
 
Yes, a back-end server is needed in the SHS, and they need to modify the apps, so those apps can connect to the back-end server.
 
(7) What happens if some parties do not cooperate when conflict happens? e.g. a higher priority party does not respond when hard conflict arises. How well do you think Kratos can handle when it or a device enters an unknown state?
 
The current implementation cannot process if some users don't respond. One of the solutions is to set a timeout. If no one responds within that window, Kratos randomly picks one to avoid deadlock. They can improve KROTOS by checking policies and priorities before the negotiation phase. This can avoid unknown states.
 
(8) Is this type of control system feasible with an IoT network that is composed of different smart devices of different vendors since it seems they only used the Samsung SmartThings platform.
Would localization of the decision making process help to lower latency, instead of sending information to the back-end module?
 
Yes, it can be implemented in any smart home platform once they modify the apps to connect to back-end. Localization won’t help because apps still need to query back-end in a multiple user environment.
