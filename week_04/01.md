## Paper Summary
This paper introduces a secure motion verification scheme based on Angle-of-Arrival and Frequency-of-Arrival that only requires a single verifier, by exploiting opportunistic signal refection paths in the environment to create multiple virtual verifiers. Which allows vehicles in a smart transportation system to share motion state information safely and efficiently, while previous approaches are often not efficient that require multiple cooperative distributed verifiers. The authors analyzed their scheme from theoretical point of view with realistic road topology.They also carried out real-world experiments for both static and moving verifiers in a campus enviroment. The results show that their scheme can accurately detect false motion claims in a low relative speed vehicular network.

## Review
### Strengths
The main strengths are as follows
- The paper introduces a novel idea that leverage opportunistic signal refection paths to generate "virtual" verifiers, which singnificantly reduces the cost of previous approaches that depend on multiple verifiers.
- The authors provide a detialed theoretical analysis of a MLE based estimator of the position and FDOA-based velocity verification scheme.
- Real-word experiments on constraint environment were performed that verifed their theoretical results.

### Weaknesses
The main weaknesses are:
- The approach requires an accurate map that records the position and angle of the surface of buildings in the area. Which is critical to perform an accurate estimation on the position and velocity based on the reflected signals.
- The authors only consider one-hop of reflection due to easy of theoretical analysis, and argue that multi-hop reflected signal will have significat lower power. However, it is possible that in an complex environment the influence of multi-hop signals be large enough due to superposition.
- The approach may not work in rural area when there are no enough reflection points.
- The experinments only carry out in an campus environment, it is not clear how the scheme performs in complex environment where multiple vehicles involved.

### Detalied Comments
The main idea of the approach is to leverage the reflected signals of one source from multiple reflection points to dertermine the actual status of the source, as illustrated in the following picture.

Due to the Doppler effect, the frequency from different reflection paths will be different at the verification point. Since all the reflection points are recorded on the map, one can therefore esteblish explicit relations between the path, AOA and FOA. To verify whether the location and velocity calims are from a valid vehicle,  one can simply check if all the relations are consistent. The whole verification scheme is illustrated in the following picture.

While this is a neat theoretical idea, there are also many practical problems as we mentioned before. The major problem is that, how accurate should the map be in order to have an acceptable estimation? And is it even feasible to do so if the surface of building are changed very often? The authors provide evaluation on two scenarios, (a) highway; (b) Urban. As illustrated in the following picture.

The average error for case (a) is 1.38m and case (b) is 0.79m. However, in both case, the reflectors are all parallel to the road.

The experinment that carried out in the paper is a convincing proof of concept. However, due to the simple environment (e.g. in one straight campus road), it is not clear how such an experinment could tell about more complicated environments. The paper also do not evaluate on what will happen with multiple vehicles involves in the scheme, e.g. what if there are multiple valid but adversary vehicles that collabritely cheating one victim vehicle.

Overall, this is a good paper with great ideas, but there are also plenty of room for improvement.



### Implementation
The authors conducted experiments in an urban street to evaluate the performance of the proposed motion verification scheme. As illustrated as follows.

{{< figure src="https://github.com/gustybear-teaching/course_ee693e_2020_fall/blob/main/week_04/images/experinment.png" title="Real-world experiment setup" width="300" >}}

Two scenarios were considered. In the first scenario, the prover is moving and the verifier is stationary; for the second, both the prover and verifier are moving in
the same direction but with varying relative speed with an initial relative distance of 3m and a maximum distance of 19.5m. The experiment is conducted for multiple runs (3 and 4 runs for scenario one and two respectively).

The prover vehile consist of a USRP N2000, which constantly broadcast a single frequency sinusoidal signal at 915 MHz using an omnidirectional antenna (VERT900) attached on the vehile trunk. The verifier is a Kerberos SDR, which is either located on the ground (Scenario One), or on the front hood of the following vehicle (Scenario Two). The Kerberos SDR works in the frequency range of 24 MHz to 1.7 GHz. Four antennas were used in a uniform circular array, with an interantenna distance d = 16.4cm. The sampling frequency is
1.024 MHz. And the signal is divided into equal length segments, each containing 32768*4 data point, with 8 segments per second.

A PCAN-USB device was used to collect the vehicle ground-truth speed via the OBD-II port at 50Hz. A GPS-equipped smartphone running GPS2IP was used to collect ground-truth location data at 1Hz for both vehicles. The actual heading direction is straight to the right. The true trajectory is from the location (0,2 )m to (0,123 )m. Data from two vehicles was synchronized by having the smartphone transmit, via a common WLAN, the same GPS coordinates to both the prover and verifier.

### Experimentation
The position difference error are showing in the following picture.
