## Paper Summary
This paper introduces a secure motion verification scheme based on Angle-of-Arrival and Frequency-of-Arrival that only requires a single verifier, by exploiting opportunistic signal reflection paths in the environment to create multiple virtual verifiers. Which allows vehicles in a smart transportation system to share motion state information safely and efficiently, while previous approaches are often not efficient that require multiple cooperative distributed verifiers. The authors analyzed their scheme from theoretical point of view with realistic road topology. They also carried out real-world experiments for both static and moving verifiers in a campus environment. The results show that their scheme can accurately detect false motion claims in a low relative speed vehicular network.

## Review
### Strengths
The main strengths are as follows
- The paper introduces a novel idea that leverage opportunistic signal refection paths to generate "virtual" verifiers, which significantly reduces the cost of previous approaches that depend on multiple verifiers.
- The authors provide a detailed theoretical analysis of a MLE based estimator of the position and FDOA-based velocity verification scheme.
- Real-word experiments on constraint environment were performed that verified their theoretical results.

### Weaknesses
The main weaknesses are:
- The approach requires an accurate map that records the position and angle of the surface of buildings in the area. Which is critical to perform an accurate estimation on the position and velocity based on the reflected signals.
- The authors only consider one-hop of reflection due to easy of theoretical analysis and argue that multi-hop reflected signal will have significant lower power. However, it is possible that in a complex environment the influence of multi-hop signals be large enough due to superposition.
- The approach may not work in rural area when there are not enough reflection points.
- The experiments only carry out in a campus environment; it is not clear how the scheme performs in complex environment where multiple vehicles involved.


### Detalied Comments
The main idea of the approach is to leverage the reflected signals of one source from multiple reflection points to determine the actual status of the source, as illustrated in the following picture.

Due to the Doppler effect, the frequency from different reflection paths will be different at the verification point. Since all the reflection points are recorded on the map, one can therefore establish explicit relations between the path, AOA and FOA. To verify whether the location and velocity claims are from a valid vehicle, one can simply check if all the relations are consistent. The whole verification scheme is illustrated in the following picture.

While this is a neat theoretical idea, there are also many practical problems as we mentioned before. The major problem is that, how accurate should the map be in order to have an acceptable estimation? And is it even feasible to do so if the surface of building is changed very often? The authors provide evaluation on two scenarios, (a) highway; (b) Urban. As illustrated in the following picture.

{{< figure src="https://github.com/gustybear-teaching/course_ee693e_2020_fall/blob/main/week_04/images/map.png" title="Maps and Reflector Extraction" width="300" >}}

The average error for case (a) is 1.38m and case (b) is 0.79m. However, in both cases, the reflectors are all parallel to the road.

The experiment that carried out in the paper is a convincing proof of concept. However, due to the simple environment (e.g., in one straight campus road), it is not clear how such an experiment could tell about more complicated environments. The paper also does not evaluate on what will happen with multiple vehicles involves in the scheme, e.g. what if there are multiple valid but adversary vehicles that collaborate cheating one victim vehicle.

Overall, this is a good paper with great ideas, but there are also plenty of room for improvement.



### Implementation
The authors conducted experiments in an urban street to evaluate the performance of the proposed motion verification scheme. As illustrated as follows.

{{< figure src="https://github.com/gustybear-teaching/course_ee693e_2020_fall/blob/main/week_04/images/experinment.png" title="Real-world experiment setup" width="300" >}}

Two scenarios were considered. In the first scenario, the prover is moving, and the verifier is stationary; for the second, both the prover and verifier are moving in
the same direction but with varying relative speed with an initial relative distance of 3m and a maximum distance of 19.5m. The experiment is conducted for multiple runs (3 and 4 runs for scenario one and two respectively).

The prover vehicle consists of a USRP N2000, which constantly broadcast a single frequency sinusoidal signal at 915 MHz using an omnidirectional antenna (VERT900) attached on the vehicle trunk. The verifier is a Kerberos SDR, which is either located on the ground (Scenario One), or on the front hood of the following vehicle (Scenario Two). The Kerberos SDR works in the frequency range of 24 MHz to 1.7 GHz. Four antennas were used in a uniform circular array, with an interantenna distance d = 16.4cm. The sampling frequency is
1.024 MHz. And the signal is divided into equal length segments, each containing 32768*4 data point, with 8 segments per second.

A PCAN-USB device was used to collect the vehicle ground-truth speed via the OBD-II port at 50Hz. A GPS-equipped smartphone running GPS2IP was used to collect ground-truth location data at 1Hz for both vehicles. The actual heading direction is straight to the right. The true trajectory is from the location (0,2 )m to (0,123 )m. Data from two vehicles was synchronized by having the smartphone transmit, via a common WLAN, the same GPS coordinates to both the prover and verifier.

### Experimentation
The position difference error is showing in the following picture.

The results of position and velocity estimations are as follows.

### Questions from audience

(1) Since this system relies on doppler effect, how would a stationary vehicle be differentiated from similar objects in the environment?

When the vehicle is not moving, the approach will not be able to differentiate it with an static object. But the position can be still verifiable through the AOA of the signal.

(2) How a FDOA-based approach verifies the velocity claims?

Since the different path have different AOA thus different frequency due to Doppler effect. We can therefore establish a relation between the path and FOA, if the velocity claim is true then it must satisfy all the relations. When we have enough paths, it will be very hard for the attacker to find a false claim that consistent with all the relations.

(3) Is this solution viable in a less populated, longer-range application (greater than 100m)?

Yes, the distance will have influence since AOA will be harder to be differentiated for different paths.

(4) How fast does this algorithm run? Can it safely detect vehicles prior to possible collisions?

The processing time is roughly 1.84s to process one segment data. This may be slow for some critical scenarios, but it should be able to be optimized.

(5) Is it possible attackers generate fake paths if they are close to the verifier?

The attacker can generate fake paths by e.g. alter the building surface, add some fake reflector or setup multiple fake transmitters. However, this is not economically viable.

(6) In a highly populated roadway, would this method confuse reflected signals as genuine?

The signal can be differentiated through the identity of the transmitter which is encoded in the signal.

(7) Why would attackers try to spoof PVA information for autonomous vehicle systems?

The attacker may gain advantage by spread fake information, e.g., slow down other vehicles and make room for himself, or cause accident maliciously.

(8) Would buildings, used as reflectors, made of lossy materials potentially contribute to making this method ineffective regarding transmitted power (signal strength)?

Yes, it can be. Since the signal can be absorbed and reduce the power of receiving signal.
