## Paper Summary
This paper delves into the creation and testing of a new protocol, Clicktok, in an attempt to detect fraudulent clicks from real clicks where ad companies may pay money per click on their ads. There are various attack methods used to generate these clicks whether it comes from a bot farm, or from malicious apps installed on a normal user's device, detecting inorganic clicks from organic clicks is a concern to prevent adversaries from profiting off from ad companies. Clicktok attempts to classify these clicks by utilizing the fact that fake generated click spam imitates user traffic in an attempt to stay stealthy. By analyzing repeating patterns in a user's click history, Clicktok aims to identify these false clicks from real clicks.

## Review
### Strengths
- This paper offers a method of detecting fraudulent clicks that does not rely on a threshold based defense.
- By taking advantage that click fraud often uses previous user traffic in order to fabricate fake clicks, Clicktok is able to identify click fraud even though the attacker may be imitating organic clicks.

### Weaknesses
- Although Clicktok seems promising in detecting fraudulent clicks at various rates of attack, it seem it may be possible for an adversary to create a method that is able to bypass Clicktok's detection system.
- It may be difficult to keep track of malicious clicks with IP aggregation and churn. As some networks may try to avoid exposing IP addresses, it makes attributing fraudulent clicks to a certain source more difficult.

### Detailed Comments
By detecting the timing characteristics of click traffic feed received at ad networks, one can detect fraudulent clicks that attempt to be stealthy by sending a low amount of clicks. This is useful as farming clicks is becoming more economical with advances in technology, meaning that more attackers can have the luxury of sending a low amount of fraudulent clicks in an attempt to not be flagged as fake. Then even with a wide range of rates which an attacker can send fake clicks, whether the adversary decides to imitate previous user clicks or generate random clicks, Clicktok is able to identify repeating patterns of the imitation clicks, or the randomness of the clicks as not being attributed to real clicks.

As for the potential weakness in Clicktok, a more advanced click randomization/generation scheme may make detecting fraudulent clicks from real organic clicks difficult. If an attacker is able to uncover how Clicktok determines fraudulent clicks, they may be able to generate a workaround towards Clicktok's defenses. Then addressing the IP aggregation and churn, as some networks may aggregate IPs, it makes identifying individual user's clicks all the more difficult which would result in a lower efficacy when identifying false clicks.

### Implementation
The paper provides an explanation into how they implemented their algorithm of Clicktok, as well as how they collected the data they used to train their model. The way they collected their data was by setting up traffic monitors on backbone routers of a university campus network. They collected a total of 217,334,190 unique clicks, between June 2015 and November 2017. The data was collected after obtaining ethical approval, and all stored data is encrypted. As for how they implemented their algorithm, they took the click traffic of each user (click stream), and attempted to decompose the click streams of each user into basic patterns by using a non-negative matrix factorization algorithm. This decomposes the click traces into pattern matrices, and weight matrices as to how often each pattern occurs.

They then use a moving window function to reduce sensitivity to synchronization errors from timing misalignments.

Afterwards by examining the weight matrix, they can determine which patterns are repeated and are potentially fraudulent clicks, as patterns matrices that are repeated can be attributed to organic click spam (fake clicks imitating user inputs). They cluster the closely related patterns matrices, to then determine inorganic click spam by finding clusters with a higher entropy, characteristic of clicks generated from a randomized/constant time offsets. The remaining clicks can then be attributed to real users.

Another technique Clicktok applies is bait clicks (active defense), where ad networks inject bait clicks, so any malicious users that may try to imitate these bait clicks are identified with Clicktok's algorithm and flagged as fraudulent.

### Experimentation
In order to evaluate Clicktok, the authors of the paper, used the click traffic obtained, filtered it and exposed it to a testbed with malicious apps and click malware. Through this they were able to get a click traffic that contained both legitimate and fake clicks.

{{< figure src="https://github.com/gustybear-teaching/course_ee693e_2020_fall/raw/main/week_02/images/ClicktokTable1.png" title="Table 1: Passive Detection" width="320" >}}
In their experimentation, they consider *stealthy* attackers to be under 5 clicks a day per device, *sparse* to be 5-15 clicks, and *firehose* to be over 15 clicks. From Table 1, it can be seen that Clicktok with a passive defense is effective in identifying click fraud. With a longer ad network duration, leads to better inference, especially against stealth attacks.

{{< figure src="https://github.com/gustybear-teaching/course_ee693e_2020_fall/raw/main/week_02/images/ClicktokTable2.png" title="Table 2: Detection Across Multiple Clickstreams" width="320" >}}
They also categorized and analyzed different click categories, where sponsored are advertisements displayed by search engines, contextual are ads displayed on a webpage based on keywords present in the webpage, and mobile are ads exclusively present on mobile devices. From the results in Table 2, it is shown that the Clicktok is able to identify fraudulent clicks across the ad categories at a high true positive rate of ~90%, and a low false positive rate at around ~0.004%.

{{< figure src="https://github.com/gustybear-teaching/course_ee693e_2020_fall/raw/main/week_02/images/ClicktokTable3.png" title="Table 3: Active Defense" width="320" >}}
When applying the active defense with bait clicks, it can be seen in Table 3, that it improves detection rates. With both the increase in true positive rates, and decrease in false positive rates, show that an active defense may be important in identifying fake clicks.

Lastly, Clicktok gives an comparation between their implementation compared to other defenses, with Clicktok providing vastly lower false positive rates comparatively, and similar or better true positive rates.

##Audience Questions
What are the causes of a synch error, factors, reasons?
The causes of synch error may be slight differences in recorded time stamps with the data, or perhaps duplicated user clicks that may happen from errors in the user's app/browser. This might lead into false transmissions.

Clicktok outperforms its competitors when analyzing low rate attacks, what is the differences it has over them?
The difference is that Clicktok is able to identify patterns where a malicious app may try to replay user clicks. So it would then be able to determine through a low rate attack if the clicks produced by the low rate is fraudulent.

What are the limitations of using threshold based approaches?
The limitations of threshold based approaches is that with how economical setting up click farms is now, adversaries can now attack with sending clicks under the threshold and still be able to profit.

The paper states that "the mimicry defense detects around 81% of fake clicks in stealthy (low rate) attacks... What about high rate attacks?"
With high rate attacks, the mimicry defense is actually even better at around 99% true positive rate for a 12 week duration with Google's ad network.

In the passive setup, the authors only demonstrated that their method works for the dataset they choose. Why can't the attacker produce click pattern that is statistically indistinguishable with real click? (i.e. an adversary attacker)
The attacker could potentially produce a click pattern that is similar to a user, but the paper focuses on malicious apps that replay user's clicks, or that uses a random/fixed interval delay to send clicks. A malicious app might require more resources to send fraudulent clicks.

Why active defense improves detection rates better than passive defense?
An active defense improves detection rates, as the bait clicks allow the defense algorithm to detect whether malicious apps are replaying the bait clicks as the bait clicks are sent with known intervals, making detection of replayed clicks better.

How would a machine learning algorithm specifically designed to mimic click patterns of humans, be able to break the algorithm?
It would probably be able to break this algorithm as this method looks for patterns in clicking and then the variance of these clicks to determine true from false clicks. So a machine learning algorithm may be able to produce similar click patterns that defeat both detection methods. With that said, it may then result in future methods of using machine learning to then detect fake clicks.

Do you think there are other factors, in addition to time patterns/properties, that can help to verify authentic click traffic to further increase the accuracy of the proposed technique(s)?
There may be other factors such as location of the IP being considered where the time in the location where a click is received might give clues as to whether the click is genuine. Other factors may also include, device type, operating system, etc., as click farms might have similar configurations.
