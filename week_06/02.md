## Paper Summary
In this paper, authors describe how they reverse-engineered and analyzed the security aspects of MagicPairing, Apple’s new Bluetooth protocol. The basic idea of Magic Pairing is once a user pairs a Bluetooth device with his/her iCloud account, that device can connect to all other Apple devices associated with the same account without extra user interactions. They explained the mechanism of MagicPairing protocol in detail and showed the vulnerabilities they found via reverse-engineering. Based on these analyses, they manually test MagicPairing for logical bugs. Further, they designed and implemented a fuzzer based on InternalBlue to conduct attacks to those vulnerabilities. They also documented what they found during their research and reported to the Apple.

## Review
### Strengths
- They reverse-engineered the source code of MagicPairing and explained the architecture and mechanism of this protocol in detail.
- Implemented an open source tool to verify the vulnerabilities they found in the reverse-engineered source code.
- They studied all MagicPairing Bluetooth stacks including macOS, iOS and RTKit.
- They documented the vulnerabilities they found and the results of their experiments.
### Weaknesses
- They provided a python script for proof of concept, but there is no instruction.
- They reverse-engineered the source code of MagicPairing, found the vulnerabilities, and reported to Apple, but they don’t provide a detailed description of how to solve those problems. Although those issues are easy to solve, not all audiences have the background knowledge of software engineering.
### Detalied Comments
MagicPairing provides seamless pairing capabilities. Once a user pairs a Bluetooth device with another device that has been connected to iCloud, then that Bluetooth device can connect to all other devices associated with that iCloud account. Thus, it scales for pairing many devices within an existing infrastructure.
MagicPairing consists of five phases as shown in Figure 1.

1. The Accessory Key is stored on iCloud, after establishing an encrypted connection the host will download and transmit it to the Bluetooth device.
2. The host device transmits a hint to the Bluetooth device, and the hint includes the Bluetooth address of the target device and a ratchet number.
3. The target device will rotate Accessory Key and use that rotated key to compute the SIV key. This is the key step to renew and maintain the short-lived session keys. Symmetric ratcheting keeps a fresh shared secret for each connection and provides forward security. Session keys won’t be compromised even if long-term keys are compromised.
4. The host will create a new AES-SIV key and send it to the target device. If the target device can decrypt the message, they pair successfully.
5. Finally, a Bluetooth-compliant connection link key is derived.
MagicPairing is not an open source protocol, so authors had to use reverse engineering tools to disassemble the protocol. After they observed the code, they found apple used three Bluetooth stacks, so studied all those stacks and found the vulnerabilities.\
They listed eight vulnerabilities and explained the causes of these vulnerabilities. It would be better if they provide a solution directly since not all readers have a background in software engineering.
### Implementation
Apple uses three different Bluetooth stacks: macOS, iOS, and RTKit OS (airPod). Each stack is for an individual device type and is implemented in different ways. The macOS kernel exposes a user-space IOKit device-interface for Bluetooth. It communicates using a Mach port. User-space applications can connect to bluetooth devices using the IOBluetooth private API. macOS bluetoothd manages all Bluetooth logic and connects to other daemons. On the other hand, iOS bluetoothd directly connects to the exposed Bluetooth socket of a device. It offers Bluetooth-related functionality as an XPC service. Compared to macOS, iOS CoreBluetooth doesn’t not allow apps to create and use Classic Bluetooth connection. Bluetoothd exposes a Mach port which can only accessed by system components. RTKit is not well-known as the previous ones, and it lacks public documentation. Therefore, it is hard to debug root causes for crashes. The message of MagicParing starts with a 2 B header followed by data. The data can be key messages or short messages. Key messages include AES, Ratchet or Hint while short messages only contain one byte.
In order to verify the vulnerabilities, they implemented an over-the-air fuzzer and an in-process fuzzing. Over-the-air fuzzer is independent of the target device’s OS or Bluetooth stack, so it has few false positives, but the speed is limited by the physical connection to the target. In-process fuzzer need to inject the fuzzer inside the target process, and it has more false positives than over-the-air fuzzer because the Bluetooth daemon is altered, which may cause unexpected issues.

### Experimentation
Their experiment setup is shown below.
{{< figure src="https://github.com/gustybear-teaching/course_ee693e_2020_fall/raw/main/week_06/images/mp_fuzzer.png" title="[Fuzzing setup]" width="800" >}}
Results are shown in Table 1. MP1 - MP5 are pointer dereference issues, while MP6 is caused by an unnecessary assertion statement. The cause of MP8 and MP9 is the prococol doesn't verify whether the ratchet numbers are valid, so attackers can set a very large ratchet number and overload the CUP. L2CAP 1 and 2 relate to null pointer and null payload.

[Replicate]\
Environment: MacBook Pro 2020, macOS Big Sur 11.0.1.\
We don’t have any old jailbroken iOS devices, so we can not install InternalBlue on iOS devices. We can do the over-the-air fuzzing on macOS only. We replicated the tests for macOS and airPod following Table 1. However, all those attacks failed, while Wireshark showed that there were packets sent to the Bluetooth ports. MP3, MP4 cannot cause Bluetooth crashes. CPU load was normal when running MP7. MP9, the attack to the airPod, can crash the bluetooth connection sometimes. Note that MP8 hasn't been implemented yet. Apple may have fixed those vulnerabilities on Big Sur.
### Questions
(1) What is the purpose of implemeting a fuzzing code "in a nutshell". How does this help better understand and improve MagicPairing.

I think one of the advantages is that even if a Bluetooth daemon crashes, the manager still can still know what happened and save the information. Since it reduces the false positives, anything found can be used comparatively easily for a PoC.

(2) If other ecosystmes wanted to implement magicpairing, what changes or additions would they need on top of theirs?

We can upgrade the software. Although MagicPairing is a custom key derivation protocol, the further usage of this key is still compliant to the Bluetooth specification and does not require any modifications to the Bluetooth chip.

(3) Why does Apple keep their Bluetooth ecosystem rather closed to third-party vendors?

A closed system is more efficient and stable because they only need to deal with a small amount of hardwares. On the other hand, it is hard to find vulnerabilities and bugs.

(4) It seems that there are a lot of MagicPairing vulnerabilities that the paper mentions. Wouldn't standard Bluetooth pairing eliminate these specific vulnerabilities/be more secure?

Most of the vulnerabilities related to the ratchet, so other implementations of Bluetooth stacks should not have those vulnerabilities. I think it is a trade off so far. However, MagicPairing is new compared to the standard Bluetooth stacks, and it will be improved as other technologies improve such as machine learning and battery.

(5) Can an attacker repeatedly (try to) pair with a Airpods to make the battery drain fast? (even if the pairing is not success

Yes, because MagicPairing doesn’t have a mechanism to avoid such an attack. Jamming can also drain the battery.

(6) Are protocols in general, that attempt to streamline the user's experience (seamless pairing, etc) more vulnerable than others?

It only requires the traditional key exchange at the first time a device pairs with iCloud. I think it may be more secured because the traditional key exchange (enter 6 digit code) is not secured as MagicPariing’s key distribution.

(7) Although we ratchet to make sure a compromised session key doesn't effect the security overall, how would an attacker get the session key in the first place?

Inject malware to the victim or man-in-the-middle attack.

(8) Is this more of an Apple vulnerability or more of a general Bluetooth vulnerability

Those vulnerabilities are caused by the MagicPairing implementation. Apple may have fixed some of them based on our replicate experiment.
