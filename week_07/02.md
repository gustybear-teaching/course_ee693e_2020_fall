## Paper Summary
Cellular baseband chips play a crucial role in  smartphone security, which parse large amounts of data before authentication. This brings concerns in security from stealthy attackers who gathers information from smartphones. This paper proposes a novel cellular fuzzing framework which aims to help security researchers find
critical bugs in cellular basebands. These fuzzing tools include a sanitizing drop-in allocator. MediaTek is one of the largest vendors for mobile phone baseband chips. And they chose MediaTek baseband as a target to implement their fuzzing techniques and prove the viability of BaseSAFE.

## Review
### Strengths
- BaseSAFE provides an API which makes it easy to quickly implement fuzz cases without additional overhead
- The drop-in sanitizing allocator finds memory corruption bugs automatically 

### Weaknesses
- This paper assumes that the reader has sufficient amount of background knowledge.   

### Detalied Comments
BaseSAFE mostly detects memory corruptions during parsing, and using BaseSAFE hooks, a lot of other logic bugs could also be modeled. For the baseband authentication, paths that reach authentication without passing the functions can be hunted down this way. BaseSAFE provides fast fuzzing speeds, emulating multiple Mediatek baseband parsers. This proves that this emulation is a good fit for automated bug discovery in baseband firmware analysis


### Implementation

First of all, they have reverse engineered and analyzed a specific baseband (MediaTek’s Helio X10 (MT6795) processor) and were able to access the unencrypted baseband firmware. MediaTek’s baseband firmware consists of two parts: the ARM and the DSP. This research focuses on the ARM portion, as this is the place where cellular plane messages are processed and, therefore, can be controlled by an external attacker. We want to focus on the LTE RRC and EMM messages, which these messages are normally used for identifying base stations and exchanged for establishing connections between a smartphone and a network. Instead of emulating the whole baseband, they selectively emulate single parsers. This would allow us to emulate quickly with zero false-positives. Some of these messages are not encrypted and decoded automatically upon the cell, which would make this valid to target a fuzzer. The selective emulation shown in Figure 2. begins from the downlink of RRC messages from the cellular network. These messages are plaintext messages without authentication processes. After collecting signal messages, they deduct the correct parser by evaluating the code coverage of different input functions compared to the code coverage of unrelated packages depecticted in Figure 3. The results of memory corruptions are found through fuzzing in different categories. This method is solved by implementing a drop-in allocator that makes use of the implemented emulator. The hooking functionality of the Unicorn engine inserts checks for conditions into a JIT code. Unicorn engine emits checks for conditions like memory accesses and executed instructions. If the check triggers, the the placed hook is called from the JIT code directly without stopping the emulation. Using this feature, they can overwrite the firmware’s internal allocator, and proceed with the BaseSAFE’s function

### Experimentation
1388 unique test cases were conducted, leading to unique paths in the parser. More paths can be identified with longer fuzzing times, which then can be stored and used to test the same message on other baseband firmwares. BaseSAFE was able to uncover out-of-bounds reads and writes in the LTE stack, which are NAS EMM parser. The bug was found in a function called decodeEmergencyNumberList where an attacker controlled the length-byte, which was not checked against the correct message size. This leaded to an out-of-bound read from the received message.

### Audience Questions

- (1) Would it be possible to use this acrchitecture for fuzzing different devices?

This fuzzing technique can be used for different devices who uses a baseband chip architecture, which this emulation focuses on. Most of which are smartphone cellular devices.

- (2) Given that smartphone hardware is growing increasingly more powerful, would it be viable to perform fuzzing on smartphones?

This paper focuses on baseband chips for smartphones. The experiment is done on chips made in the year 2015. The entire fuzzing process cannot be done on the phone itself. The emulation is running on a seperate software, extracting the memory from the phone. The phone does not have sufficient power.

- (3) Considering the fuzzing can only detect memory using bugs, how useful is this approach?

By detecting bugs within the system, we are able to determine whether or not that there is an attacker. This includes out-of-bound reads, where an attacker controlled the length-byte, or other attacks. This fuzzing framework aims to increase security.

- (4) Would fuzzing be more effective in finding bugs for low level kernels (mobile) or high level kernels (desktop)?

Findings bugs on lower level kernals would be easier and faster because there is more access between the software and hardware. Higher level kernals have more abstractions, such as drivers that may directly affect how effective fuzzing would work.

- (4) For the Fuzz API, why some of them are implemented with fork(), and some of them are implemented with presistent mode?

- (5) Why do smartphones parse data before authentication?

- (6) Is it a purposeful choice for the baseband to be closed-source?

- (7) Will 5G baseband chips affect the implementation of BaseSAFE? Is it still applicable?
