## Presentation

Attacker models are the foundation of any evaluation of security. As The capabilities of the attacker change over time, it is important to periodically re-evaluate if attacker models that were considered impractical in the past Perhaps today does not pose a potential threat. In this work, they assess the risk of facial cancellation of wireless radio signal attacks current advances in capabilities for software-defined radio attackers. Unlike typical models of radio interference or jamming attackers, adding noise to legitimate communication, signal cancelation attacks are designed to interact destructively with the legitimate signal in order to delete certain signals from the spectrum. Although signal cancelation attacks have been found to be impractical in the analog domain, they examine the device requirements to execute such attacks digitally using SDRs and assess the feasibility of launching such attacks. Attacks on wireless communication devices, such as GPS.

## Review
### Strengths
A legitimate transmitter and an attacker, each fitted with either an omnidirectional or directional antenna, are part of their system model. An omnidirectional antenna is installed on the legitimate receiver. Multiple antennas or any other Multiple Input Multiple Output (MiMo) systems are not used by any legitimate players. Although the attacker may be equipped with extra antennas and receivers, they do not play a direct role in the cancelation of the signal, but rather include contextual information about the legitimate signal.
- Achieve attenuation for complex GPS CDMA modulated signals.
- Evaluate with coaxial cables, and over the air.
- Evaluate attacker’s accuracy in phase and amplitude

### Weaknesses
A signal is transmitted by the legitimate transmitter, modulated on a carrier, which in turn receives the legitimate receiver. Their work does not make the modulation scheme an assumption or requirement, but they assume that the attacker will anticipate certain parts or the entire signal from the legitimate transmitter. To create a digital copy of the signal to be cancelled locally, the digital signal cancellation attacker exploits predictable parts of the signal.
- Tens of degrees of phase error still allows the attacker to attenuate the whole GPS constellation by approximately 10dB and by 20dB.


### Detalied Comments
The GPS signals are very complex due to the modulation of the CDMA and the goal is to see if the same degree of attenuation is possible as with the unmodulated carrier and if it is possible to cancel individual satellite signals from the CDMA spectrum. Both by coaxial cables and over the radio, they determine this. They then measure the actions of a commercial GPS receiver in the Chain of signal processing when such an attack is launched against the actual satellites and the constellation. Finally, the exposure to the precision of the attacker's signals is tested in both Amplitude and phase. In order to make them possible to replicate, the GPS signals must be canceled and the attacker's signals are both produced using the software gps-sdr-sim. In order to maximize the signal from the noise, GPS receivers use dispreading techniques. An attacker must attenuate the signals to a very low level, rendering it more difficult to monitor the properties of the signal.

### Implementation
In their estimates of the potential attenuation of such threats, they are Make use of the devices following. On the side of the transmitter, we Use two Ettus-manufactured USRP X300 equipped SBX400 daughterboards. From an external clock signal, transmitters are synchronized. For direct signal strength and spectrum calculations, they use an FSQ8 signal analyzer by Rhode & Schwarz on the receiver side. they use the commercially available u-blox M8 GNSS Test Package EVK-M8T for non-spectrum GPS calculation. To test the signal cancellation, they use two separate setups. We attach antennas to both transmitters in one configuration (Figure 8a). Using the air as a transmitting medium and receiver. They attach the transmitters and the receiver to the coaxial cable in the second configuration (Figure 8b), combine the two signals with a signal combiner and feed them into the receiver. A cable-based setup allows them to avoid any interference in the lab from the indoor, multipath-rich system. Every used cable was 60 cm in length and 60 cm in length if not specified differently. The antennas were mounted on the side of an equilateral triangle 2 m deep. They change the phase and amplitude of the attacker's signals in order to adjust the Rely on GNURadio software that varies the generated values Samples for IQ. Because in a shielded laboratory setting, GPS synchronization of their transmitters is not possible, they use a local clock to control the transmitters' local oscillators. They either use a single system with two front-end transmission-denoted one-stage synchronization-or two separate devices with an external clock synchronized local oscillators-denoted two Synchronization of point. They transmit GPS signals over the air in order to avoid regulatory concerns. In a shielded laboratory area only.

### Experimentation

They first test the cancellation of the digital signal on an unmodulated carrier signal. The studies shown were both replicated over and over. Over the air and over coaxial cables. At a carrier signal, they transmit the carrier signal of 1.5GHz frequency with a front-end gain of 0dB to prevent additional distortions of the They produce various signal strengths in the baseband at the transmitter, before transmitting, by adjusting the amplitudes from 0dBFSS. In steps of 10dB, down. Signal that is produced. The overall attenuation for the cable and air setups obtained as seen in Figure 9.
In the next experiment, roughly Tx#1 and Tx#2 are located Separated by 5 meters. The receiver (Rx) is located at separate intervals spaced 2.5 m steps apart from both transmitters and without the attacker's signal present, the peak signal power is measured. they measured the achievement for each distance the cancellation signal was triggered. The findings are illustrated in Figure 10.
The attenuation obtained decreases marginally over the distance. Furthermore, this does not mean that the attack operates worse over time. The signal power without attack often suggests a downward trend 
Due to the lack of path. The digital attacker cancels the legitimate signal down into the noise floor by about 30dB even over a span of 25m. These studies are the first to prove that signal cancellation attacks over distances of up to 25 m are effective over more than 30 dB.

### Audience Questions
-	How effective is the GPS cancelation currently, how might it be improved on in the future?

-	How effective/is this attack still viable for distances over 25m?

-	What is the advantage of the cancellation attack compare to noise adding attack? Will it hide the attacker from being dicovered by the reciever?

-	Would beamforming at the transmitter/receiver's end prevent this cancellation attack?

-	How to prevent cancellation attack?

-	When sending data between Alice and Bob, could you embed your message into a pseudo random stream, so its more difficult for the attacker to predict the signal?

- How well can this attack scale? How much more equipment do you need to attack two transmitters and two recievers?

- Do you foresee any fundamental difficulties with trying to apply these types of cancellation attacks to higher frequency signals?
